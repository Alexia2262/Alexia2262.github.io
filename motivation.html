<h1>Motivation!</h1>
 
  

  <h1>Theory</h1>
  <h3>
    According to MSG (Management Study Guide) Motivation is Motivation<br>
     is the word derived from the word ’motive’ which means needs, desires,<br>
      wants or drives within the individuals. It is the process of<br>
     stimulating people to actions to accomplish the goals. They state<br>
      that In the work goal context the psychological factors stimulating<br>
       the people’s behaviour can be -<br>
    •	desire for money<br>
    •	success<br>
    •	recognition<br>
    •	job-satisfaction<br>
    •	team work<br><br>
    Dylan Buckley, a Motivation Expert claims that different <br>
     types of motivation fall into two main categories –<br>
•	Intrinsic Motivation<br>
•	Extrinsic Motivation<br>
He states that Intrinsic motivation is a type of motivation in which<br>
 an individual is being motivated by internal desires and that Extrinsic<br>
  motivation, on the other hand, is a type of motivation in which an <br>
  individual is being motivated by external desires.<br><br>
  Briana Steinhilber , a writer for “BETTER by today” says that except<br>
   the two categories – Intrinsic Motivation and Extrinsic Motivation <br>
   there is a third one named Family. She argues that finding intrinsic<br>
    motivation isn’t always easy, especially for those of us who aren't<br>
     passionate about our work. Luckily, there is a way to compensate: <br>
     Think about your family. This has emerged as a third source of motivation<br>
      proven to be a strong source of inspiration — even for those who do<br>
       not feel intrinsically or extrinsically motivated to do something.

  <h1>TED Talk</h1>
  <h3>According to the TED talk with Dan Pink motivation is the source of<br>
     productivity and efficiency which gets determined in oneself by three things – <br>
    •	Autonomy – the urge to direct our own lives<br>
    •	Mastery – the desire to get better and better at something that matters<br>
    •	Purpose – The yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves<br>
    The way I can influence my own motivation is by reminding myself constantly<br>
     why I am doing what I am doing and make a habit of always making the time<br>
      of reflecting and working on getting better in order to stay motivated.<br>
       It is proven that accomplishing tasks gives you a rush of happiness which<br>
        makes you want to do more and essentially keeping a constant cycle of<br>
         motivation resulting in working which results in motivation and so on.

    <h1>Performance Motivation</h1>
    <h3>My Test Results from “Are you Intrinsically or Extrinsically Motivated?”<br>
       showed that I am 40% (the highest result) primarily intrinsically motivated.<br>
        According to the test I am able to enjoy myself in any kind of situation<br>
         because I join activities not because of the reward or result but for the<br>
          experience. I 100% agree with that statement as mostly I am motivated <br>
          because of the experience I will gain from the activity at hand rather<br>
           than from the reward which I find extremely important in order to be <br>
           able to grow and progress as a person. 30% of test claims that I lied<br>
            while doing this test. I believe this is because some of the questions<br>
             weren’t relevant at all and I found them even insulting at times as it<br>
              was visible what results would come up depending on the answers and <br>
              therefore the test was easy to manipulate. The other two results are<br>
               not correct as they say I am either not motivated or am extrinsically<br>
                motivated. Two incorrect statements about my character as I do not<br>
                 desire financial or any kind of reward in order to be motivated as<br>
                  that in my believe would make me immoral.</h3>

<h3>Creativity:<br>
  In comparison to the reference group I scored extremely high on this value. <br>
  I agree with this statment not only because I was graded as very creative on the <br>
  Pitch assigment but also because I believe that being creative in the workplace<br>
   is extremely important as Dan Pink said Google creates one of their best<br>
    applications while doing whatever they want without any rules or borders,<br>
     letting their creativity flow freely.I have used this the method of Google<br>
      without realizing it when I worked in Marketing at a company in my home country.<br>
       We would commonly get together with my colleagues and brainstorm on ideas<br>
        without thinking about budget and other problems just raw ideas. We created most<br> 
        of our strategies in those meetings. They resulted in brilliant adds for the<br>
         company and for the employees who felt respected as every idea was heard.<br><br>

  Work-life balance:<br>
  In comparison to the reference group I scored extremely high on this value.<br>
    I have always had the need of balance between work and private life in order <br>
    to be my best version in both aspects of my life. Having the opportunity to<br>
     make my own schedule has helped me greatly in the past as I have noticed<br>
      that when I spent just the time I need on a project I do it more efficiently<br> 
      and have extra time with my family and friends compared to if I had to stay <br>
      in an office for 8 hours every day.<br><br>

  Self-development:<br>
   In comparison to the reference group I scored below average on this value.<br>
    I think the result is below average because I do not strongly believe in<br>
     developing in personal aspect in the working environment as I believe you<br>
      should develop personally in your personal time and your professional aspect<br>
       in your profession. I believe you should never depend on your workplace to<br>
        give you opportunities to develop personally as that is not their job.<br>
  </h3>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<h3>In Conclusion I believe there is a long road ahead of me of self-development and growth regarding my motivation.<br>
From what I have learned from the Ted Talk, my research on motivation and my Pitch meeting feedback <br>
is that there are many ways one can be motivated but in the end for me it all sums up into <br>
just having your heart in the right place in order to stay motivated. In order to do that I have to <br>
be able to evaluate myself frequently on questions like "Whu am I doing this" in order to stay focused <br>
on my goals.<br> <br>
I asked for the feedback of one of my closest friends Rosi and here is what she had to say:<br>
"I trully believe that when Alia puts her mind to it she can do basically anything, even though<br>
she tends to slack from time to time she always gets herself back together when it is important."  </h3>
