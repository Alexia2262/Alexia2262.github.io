            <h4>Huawei</h4>
            <h3>* Huawei did not surprise me with their “hard work is the only way to success” method of working as they are a company situated in a communist country where the believe is “ if you are miserable you haven’t tried enough” and even though that kind of competitive culture can be a very toxic working environment they’re leading in earnings.

    <h4>Your Surprice</h4>
    <h3>This company is on top of my list and here is why:<br>
        The work atmosphere there looks very pleasant. I found the company to be with young<br>
         and open culture that encourages everyone to contribute to the overall success with their<br>
          own ideas. The flat hierarchy, I believe (As I have noticed similar situations in the university),<br>
           makes it easy to talk to CEOs about their own development or general work. Interns are paid<br>
            according to general rate, which is generous as that is volunteering. All of these qualities<br>
             make it the perfect company for a young motivated and creative person like me.<br>

        <img src="ys.jfif" alt="pink" class="center" width="" height=""> 
    <h4>Macaw</h4>
    <h3>This company is my second choice on this list and here is why:<br>
        From what I have gathered Macaw works mostly with the latest technology.<br>
         Has good collaboration with colleagues and If you need help, everyone would <br>
         be there for you. Also, they help their customers with a high-quality solution,<br>
          thus building a long-term relationship with the customer. I also appreciated the<br>
           diverse culture they have in that company as I said already, I find it very important<br>
            to be diverse in a company in order to have many different ideas. These qualities<br>
             give the employee the opportunity to build strong connections in the working environment<br>
              however I believe it is more specialized in people who already have experience.<br>

        </h3>
        <img src="about-macaw.jpg" alt="pink" class="center" width="" height=""> 
    <h4>Vera code</h4>
    <h3>This company is my third choice on this list and here is why:<br>
        I found Veracode to be  a good place to work with good environment for learning new technologies,<br>
         mentors who are always there to help which I find very important to have in a company, and also<br>
          they have flexible work hours. However I did not find them particularly diverse or open-minded<br>
           which in my believe is not the best work culture.<br>
